# Paymenter-Extensions
Working on some extensions for Paymenter to integrate with Tripletex. This is still WIP and under development!


Create a new extension using the CLI command php artisan p:extension:create and follow the instructions. Make sure you are in the paymenter folder or this command won't work. 
After creating the folder for the extension you need to enther the folder of your extension and edit the php file with your code.
